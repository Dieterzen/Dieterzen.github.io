      <p class="card-text">On September 26 we had to present 3 GIP ideas. My ideas were:</p>
      <p class="card-text">1: the advanced Useless box.</p>
      <p class="card-text">2: self-rechargeable luminous shoes.</p>
      <p class="card-text">3: the biggest gameboy in the world.</p>
      <p class="card-text">In the end, my teacher chose the advanced useless box for my final project.</p>

      <p class="card-text">I have started the research. Initially it seems quite simple to make an advanced useless box. I found a guide it may be in Polish but luckily google translate exists!</p>

      <h4 class="card-title">November 2019</h4>
    <p class="card-text">I am now sure that I have found all the time I need for the purchase. At a garage clean-up, I also found a perfect wooden box. Although it is an old box, it looks perfect for an advanced useless box. I also went to the local electronics store to see if they have all the parts I need there. The gentleman who runs the store gave me 2 booklets from Velleman and she told me to email him what I need so that he can prepare everything for me.</p>

   <h4 class="card-title">March 2020</h4>
   <p class="card-text"> This month I was told that the internship abroad to Italy will be canceled. Was to be expected as Italy now has the most corona cases in the world. It is unfortunate but it is for our safety. There is still a possibility for domestic internship. I found this internship internship the same day. My future boss understood that it was a unique situation, he accepted me but would like an official document from school. Bad news again today. The internship abroad to France was also canceled yesterday, but today also the internship abroad to Germany. The domestic internships are now also being canceled so today I am going back to Smart PC to report the sad news. Today is Friday and the government is following France with corona measures. The schools are now closed until the end of the Easter holidays. Now I have more time to work on my GIP. This month, I finally got permission to recycle parts of the old printer from my mom. That will make the motor-driven part easier anyway.</p>

 <h4 class="card-title">April 2020</h4>
 <p class="card-text">It turns out I'm still missing a part. A very important part. An l9110 H-Bridge Module without this can burn out my Arduino if I connect my motor. The part is not sold in Trials (the local electronics store) so I have to order it online.</p>

 <h4 class="card-title">May 2020</h4>
 <p class="card-text">The part has arrived and I can now start testing my code. First instances are going well and there is movement. It is now a few days later since the previous sentence and it is now going less well. My motor goes back and forth very quickly from the power supply but does nothing for the rest and does not want to listen to my switch inputs.</p>

 <h4 class="card-title">June 2020</h4>
 <p class="card-text">After a long time on my code I think it should work now. I no longer get any movement I think my DC motor has burnt out, luckily I have a backup motor. After a lot of effort I was able to change the engine. When I turned it on it turned very quickly. I also saw that my stretcher was not properly tightened. I have lowered my engine speed but there is no movement again. My backup DC motor has now also burned out. I do not have access to a third DC motor. One of my friends said to me that toy cars also have DC motors so now I will open a toy car for the DC motor. It did not help the third DC motor almost immediately. I don't have a single DC motor now.  </p>
